        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (80g) plain yogurt or sour cream, at room temperature</li>

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Lowering the oven
          rack prevents the top of your bread from browning too much, too soon. Grease the baking pan with nonstick
          spray, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk the dry ingredients(flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon) together in one bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Using your mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together in the
          other mixing bowl on high speed until smooth and creamy(about 2 minutes). </li>
        <li>With the mixer running on medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract until combined.</li>
        <li>With the mixer running on low speed, slowly transfer and beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients
          until no dry pockets remain. Do not over-mix. If you add in nuts, fold those in by hand.</li>
        <li>Pour and spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 60–65 minutes, making sure to loosely
          cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from getting too brown. The bread is
          done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs. This may be
          after 60–65 minutes depending on your oven, so begin checking every 5 minutes around the 60-minute mark.</li>
        <li>Remove bread from the oven and allow the bread to cool in the pan set on a wire rack for 1 hour. Remove
          bread from the pan and cool bread directly on the wire rack until ready to slice and serve.</li>
        <li>Cover and store banana bread at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Banana
          bread tastes best on day 2 after the flavors have settled together</li>
      </ol>
